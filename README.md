# Speg
Have you tried to add test coverage to an existing codebase? Imagine how tedious it is to manaully create each test/spec file?
This gem automagically generates and sets up test/spec files, you do not have to spend time creating each file manaully, it reads your file structure and genrates the files accordingly.

## Example
In the model directory, if a file `models/user.rb` exists, the corresponding spec file will be generated at `spec/models/users_spec.rb` or `test/models/users_test.rb`, depending on whether you are using Rspec or Minitest. It also generates files in controllers, helpers, adapters and services directory.
Assume you are using Rspec, the `user_spec.rb` file will contain, then you can continue with writing actual tests!

```
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe User do
end
```

## Installation

`$ gem install speg`

OR

Add to your Gemfile `gem 'speg'`

Run bundle install

## Usage

## For Rspec
if your test framework is Rspec, ensure you have rspec installed and setup.

Run `$ speg --rspec`

The command will generate spec files into your spec directory. 

## For Minitest
if your test framework is Minitest, ensure you have minitest setup.

Run `$ speg --minitest`

The command will generate test files into your test directory.
